// Single integration seam between this slice and the host app (os-vps).
// EVERYTHING OS-specific funnels through here — shell services (toasts,
// inspector, activity), the fs/api client, and responsive detection — so
// lifting the slice to the rr catalog means swapping THIS file for injected
// capabilities. No other file in the slice imports from outside it (UI
// primitives `@/components/ui/*` + `@/lib/utils` excepted; rr installs those).
