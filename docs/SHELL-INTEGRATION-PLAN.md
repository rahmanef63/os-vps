# Shell → os-vps Integration Plan

> **Goal:** pull the good parts of the sibling repo **shell.rahmanef.com**
> (portfolio/CMS desktop OS) into **os-vps (Topside)** — widgets, context-menu
> polish, desktop UX — *without* diluting os-vps's essence as a **VPS control
> surface** and *without* touching the file-explorer.
>
> Both repos are diverged forks of the same `rr` slice registry (appshell,
> glass-desktop, command-menu, image-picker, file-explorer, theming). This plan
> is the extraction contract in that direction: **shell → os-vps only.**
>
> Baseline: 2026-07-12. No prior integration plan existed (`SHELL-FIDELITY-PLAN.md`
> is a different goal — OS-native *look*, not sibling-feature *port*). Findings
> below come from a full head-to-head feature audit of both repos on this date.

## 0. Hard constraints (read first)

These are non-negotiable. Every task below is checked against them.

1. **Keep os-vps's essence.** Topside is a *web cockpit for a headless VPS* —
   value is **utility** (terminal / files / monitor / browser), not "an OS".
   Self-contained single Next.js app, **no Convex, no database, no external
   agent**, HMAC signed-cookie device-approval auth, host access via `lib/host`.
   Any port that needs a cloud DB or a user-role system is **out of scope** (§4).
2. **Do NOT disturb the file-explorer.** `frontend/slices/files-manager` runs on
   the real VPS host backend + zip/upload flows; it has diverged from shell's
   Convex/mock file-explorer by *purpose*. No port touches its data/hooks layer.
   (Per repo memory: the two file slices must not be merged.)
3. **No new runtime dependencies** unless a port genuinely can't be done with the
   existing stack (shadcn + Tailwind 4 + the appshell buses). The widget engine
   is pure CSS/DOM + a store — no framer-motion, no grid lib.
4. **One window store.** Shells stay chrome-only; never fork `appshell/lib/store.ts`.
5. **os-vps rules stay in force:** ≤200 lines/file, single responsibility,
   shadcn primitives only, theme tokens not hex, mobile-first, barrel-only
   cross-slice imports (`@/features/<slug>`).

## 1. Comparison table — every feature area, both repos

Legend — **Better**: which repo's implementation is stronger today.
**Action**: what os-vps should do (✅ already ahead / ↔ parity / ⬇ port from shell / ⛔ out of scope).

| # | Feature area | shell.rahmanef.com | os-vps (Topside) | Better | Action for os-vps |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Window mgmt** (open/close/snap/drag/tiling) | thirds-tiling presets, tab groups, Spaces, pinned PiP, chrome-inset re-tile, animated exits | halves+maximize snap, drag-edge preview, tabs, Spaces, close-guards, **section-relative coords + host-aware** | ↔ tie | ✅ Keep. Optional: port **thirds-tiling presets** (`l13/l23/r13/r23`) — pure geometry, low risk |
| 2 | **Desktop & shells** | 6 shells (macOS/Win/iOS/Android/Dashboard/mobile-Dashboard) | 5 shells (macOS/Win/iOS/Android/Dashboard) + **URL-synced windows** | ↔ tie | ✅ Keep. os-vps's routing is a genuine advantage |
| 3 | **Dock / taskbar / launcher / switcher** | macOS dock magnify, Fluent taskbar, Launchpad, ⌘Tab | same, per-shell idiomatic, chunk-warming | ↔ tie | ✅ Keep |
| 4 | **Widgets** | 12-col grid canvas, gallery picker, per-space persistence, 13 S/M/L widget types | **free-drag layer** — 15 types (cpu/mem/disk/net/uptime/clock/calendar/tasks/timer/notes/html/embed/quicklinks/theme/shell), picker + per-widget right-click S/M/L, **free drag-to-move + 2 Spaces (pager + Move-to-Space)**, live VPS telemetry + sparklines, persisted | ↔ **parity** | ✅ **Shipped** — types + drag + spaces all match. shell's `system` = os-vps's split cpu/mem/disk/net; `prayer`/`email` skipped (portfolio, not VPS) |
| 5 | **Context menu / right-click** | portal-stacked, arrow-key nav, focus-restore, Fluent variant; surfaces: desktop, icons, **window title-bar**, dock, taskbar, widget | **registry-based** (`registerContextMenu`) + now **window title-bar menu** (Maximize/Minimize/Pin/Close), **View as {shell}** + **Full Screen** on desktop, per-widget S/M/L, dock, taskbar | ↔ parity (os-vps registry is more extensible) | ✅ **Shipped**. Remaining shell-only: desktop-icon menu (no desktop icons yet — deferred) |
| 6 | **Command palette / spotlight** | cmdk, i18n, **MRU recent-commands history** | bespoke, apps+actions+registry commands + **live VPS fs search** | ↔ tie | ⬇ Port **MRU history** only (§2.5). Keep os-vps's fs search |
| 7 | **App registry & catalog** | 3 registries, lazy bundles, Store metadata | manifest + runtime install/create-app | ↔ tie | ✅ Keep |
| 8 | **App list** | 17 portfolio apps; **no terminal/browser/editor/monitor** | 13 utility apps: **Terminal (pty), Browser (Playwright), Code, Monitor, image+reel editors** | 🟢 **os-vps** | ✅ This *is* the essence — never regress |
| 9 | **File explorer** ⚠️ | sidebar dir-tree, preview pane, properties dialog, mock/convex/live adapters | **real VPS host fs**, zip, upload-progress, inspector | ↔ tie | ⛔ **Do NOT disturb** (constraint #2). Sidebar-tree only, deferred & behind a flag (§3-Deferred) |
| 10 | **Theming / appearance** | 36 presets, 1-hex rebrand, toolbar quick-picker | **same engine** (shell literally "ported from os-vps"), live wallpapers | ↔ tie | ⬇ Optional: **theme-quick-picker** toolbar switcher (§2.6) |
| 11 | **Notifications** | toast→history, per-app badges, calendar in center | toasts + center + **Dynamic Island live-activity bus** | ↔ tie | ✅ Keep |
| 12 | **Settings** | single appearance panel + auto-lock | **multi-section** (AI/Server/Browser/Devices/Theme…) | 🟢 **os-vps** | ⬇ Port only **auto-lock timeout** + deep-link scroll (§2.7) |
| 13 | **Backend / data** | Convex Cloud + IndexedDB + mock fs | **self-contained host control plane** (fs/exec/pty/browser) + jail + audit | 🟢 **os-vps** | ⛔ Convex is out of scope — contradicts essence |
| 14 | **Auth / RBAC** | session-token RBAC, PBKDF2, 6-role matrix, invites | **device-approval** HMAC cookie, single-owner | 🟢 os-vps (for its model) | ⛔ Multi-user RBAC out of scope — os-vps is a personal cockpit |
| 15 | **Resume / portfolio / CMS** | **full headless CMS** driving public site (portfolio/blog/services) | **none** | 🟢 shell (for its purpose) | ⛔ Out of scope — os-vps is not a portfolio |
| 16 | **Media / editors** | image-picker only (no editor) | **image-editor ~6.5k LOC + reel-editor ~6.4k LOC + viewer** | 🟢 **os-vps** | ✅ Keep — major os-vps asset |
| 17 | **Keyboard shortcuts** | ⌘-bindings + Shortcuts reference app | **focus-scoped** hotkeys + cheat-sheet registry | ↔ tie | ✅ Keep (focus-scoping is better) |
| 18 | **Mobile responsiveness** | iOS+Android+mobile-Dashboard chromes | same + DRY primitives (MasterDetail/AppFrame…) | ↔ tie | ✅ Keep (finish Phase-E adoption per `MOBILE-RESPONSIVE-PLAN.md`) |
| 19 | **Assistant / AI** | real agent loop — `os` tools drive the OS, **no approval gate** (auto-executes) | **real host-tool agent** — Alfa runs fs/exec on the VPS via a lifted tool loop; **every mutation is approve-per-call** (exec shows exact cmd + destructive badge), LIVE/MOCK banner, over the existing jail+audit | 🟢 **os-vps** (safer — shell auto-executes) | ✅ **Shipped** v1 (fs + gated shell; delete/browser/pty deferred). Needs an Anthropic key (BYOK, Settings → AI) to drive the model |
| 20 | **Desktop UX** (hot corners / marquee / icons) | hot-corners, marquee rubber-band select, desktop icons, unified arrange grid | **none** (bare desktop, right-click menu only) | 🟢 **shell** | ⬇ **P1** hot-corners + marquee (low risk); icons deferred (§2.4) |

**Summary:** os-vps is *ahead* where it matters to its identity (real host apps,
editors, routing, self-contained backend). shell is ahead on **desktop polish**
(widgets, hot-corners, marquee, agent execution) and carries a whole **portfolio/CMS**
world that is deliberately irrelevant to a VPS cockpit. The port list is therefore
short and surgical, not a merge.

## 2. Integration backlog (what to actually port)

Prioritized. Each item: source path in shell, effort, risk to essence, whether it
touches the file-explorer.

| P | Item | Effort | Risk to essence | Touches file-explorer? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **P0** | Editable widget framework (glass-desktop) | High | **Low** (reinforces VPS identity) | No |
| **P1** | Context-menu UX polish | Low | None | No |
| **P1** | Hot corners | Low | None | No |
| **P1** | Marquee (rubber-band) selection | Low–Med | None (app-shortcut layer only) | No |
| **P2** | ✅ Real agent tool-execution loop — **shipped** (Alfa drives fs/exec, approve-per-call gate) | Med | None | No |
| **P2** | ✅ Force-quit dialog (⌥⌘⎋) — **shipped** (⌥⌘⎋ + palette, lists open windows, Force Quit) | Low | Low | No |
| **P2** | OS sounds + HUD bezel | Low | None | No |
| **P3** | Command-palette MRU history | Low | None | No |
| **P3** | Theme quick-picker (toolbar) | Low | None | No |
| **P3** | Settings: auto-lock timeout | Low | None | No |
| **P3** | Window thirds-tiling presets | Low | None | No |
| **P4** | Windows-shell chrome extras (action-center / run-dialog / task-view / tray) | Med | Low–Med (Windows persona only) | No |
| **Defer** | File-explorer sidebar-tree / preview / properties | High | **High** | **Yes → deferred** |

### 2.1 — P0: Editable widget framework `[flagship]`
**Source:** `shell.rahmanef.com/features/glass-desktop` (69 files, ~5.3k LOC) —
`lib/widget-registry.ts` (13 widgets), `layout-store.ts` (per-space persistence),
`components/engine/widget-canvas.tsx` (12-col drag/resize grid),
`components/config/widget-picker-grid.tsx` (gallery), `components/widgets/**`.

**Why it wins & fits:** os-vps's `appshell/features/widgets` is 225 LOC of 3
non-editable cards. shell has a real registry with drag/resize/persistence and
**VPS-native widget types** (System Monitor, Theme picker, Shell picker) — the
registry comment literally says it's "curated for the VPS OS, drive the OS from
the wallpaper". Porting it *strengthens* the cockpit identity.

**Source choice:** vendor from **shell** — its `glass-desktop` is the *curated
13-widget VPS variant* (`lib/layout-store.ts`, free-move), already trimmed for a
cockpit. The canonical rr registry (`resources/frontend/slices/glass-desktop`) is
a **47-widget superset** with a different `use-layout` reflow-pack model — pull
extra widget *families* from there later if breadth is wanted, but the shell
variant is the right starting point. **Direction:** this is a shell→os-vps
cherry-pick (sanctioned). Do **not** confuse it with lifting shell→rr, which is
forbidden/destructive (the two glass-desktops diverged by purpose).

**Plan:**
1. Vendor `glass-desktop` as a new slice `frontend/slices/glass-desktop/`
   (barrel `@/features/glass-desktop`). It's the most self-contained shell slice
   (vendors its own `ui/` + `cn`) — the model to follow per shell's CONTRACTS.md.
2. Wire the shell-agnostic seams os-vps must supply: **grid pitch, drag,
   right-click** come from the host — reuse os-vps's existing marquee/context-menu
   registry (P1) so widgets and (later) desktop icons share ONE selection + drag +
   snap coordinator, exactly as shell does with `desktop-arrange.ts`.
3. Feed the **System Monitor widget** from os-vps's real `useSystemStats`
   capability (it already wants live host telemetry — free win over shell's mock).
4. Persist layout in `localStorage` (`os-vps:widgets:*`), per-space, matching the
   window-layout persistence model. No host/DB dependency.
5. Mount into the existing `desktopWidgets` + `today` slots via `defineFeature`;
   keep the current 3-card `DesktopWidgets` as fallback until the grid is green.
6. **Prune** shell-only widget types that don't fit a VPS (e.g. Email inbox,
   Prayer times) or gate them; keep System/Clock/Calendar/Tasks/Timer/Notes/
   Markdown/HTML/Embed/Theme/Shell-picker.

**Verify:** on demo `:4006` desktop (os-browser @1280) — add/remove/resize a
widget, reload, layout persists; System widget shows live CPU in Live mode.

### 2.2 — P1: Context-menu UX polish
**Source:** `shell.rahmanef.com/features/appshell/components/shells/context-menu.tsx`
**Correction to the task premise:** os-vps is **not** missing right-click — its
`appshell/lib/context-menu.ts` registry is *more* advanced. Only these UX bits are
missing, all additive to the existing render (no data-model change):
- `createPortal(…, document.body)` so the menu always out-stacks dock/menu-bar.
- ArrowUp/Down keyboard nav + auto-focus first item.
- Focus restoration to the trigger on close.
- Optional `data-shell="windows"` Fluent variant (icon gutter, 34px rows).
**Risk:** none. file-explorer keeps its own `file-context-menu.tsx`, untouched.

### 2.3 — P2: Real agent tool-execution loop
**Source:** `shell.rahmanef.com/shared/agentic/**` (`agent-loop.ts`, `registry.ts`,
`define.ts`) + `lib/os-tools.ts`. os-vps's Alfa assistant streams chat but its
tools "execute nothing / automations just narrate" (`assistant/lib/tools.ts`).
Port shell's agent-loop and bind it to os-vps's **already-cataloged** tool groups
(files/apps/media/system/editor/terminal/browser/settings) + the AI Inspector
context. This makes Alfa actually drive the host — a big cockpit upgrade.
**Risk:** none to essence, but respect the host jail: agent fs/exec tools must go
through `lib/host` (bounds + audit), never raw. BYOK stays via `/api/config`.

### 2.4 — P1/deferred: Hot corners + marquee (icons deferred)
**Source:** `appshell/components/{hot-corners.tsx, marquee-selection.tsx,
use-icon-positions.ts, desktop-arrange.ts}`.
- **Hot corners** (P1, no risk): pointer-position listener firing existing shell
  actions (Mission Control / show-desktop / Launchpad). Drop-in.
- **Marquee selection** (P1, low risk): ship the rubber-band + arrange grid over
  an **app-shortcut layer only** — shares the coordinator built for widgets (§2.1).
- **Desktop file icons** (DEFER, medium risk): would imply a desktop *file*
  surface leaning on the file-explorer host adapter → treat as separate task,
  constraint #2. Marquee without file-icons is safe.

### 2.5 — P3: Command-palette MRU history
**Source:** `command-menu/lib/cmdkHistory.ts`. Add a small `localStorage` MRU list
rendered in os-vps's existing Spotlight **when the query is empty**. Keep the live
fs search. ~30 LOC, no risk.

### 2.6 — P3: Theme quick-picker toolbar
**Source:** `appshell/components/theme-quick-picker.tsx`. A compact menu-bar preset
switcher so users re-theme without opening full Settings. Same appearance engine —
purely additive.

### 2.7 — P3: Settings — auto-lock + deep-link scroll
Port only shell's `autoLockMinutes` control (feeds a lock-screen idle timer — os-vps
already has `lock-screen`) and the "scroll to section" deep-link pattern. Everything
else in os-vps Settings is already broader.

### 2.8 — P2 grab-bag: force-quit, OS sounds, HUD bezel
Small self-contained ports: `force-quit-dialog.tsx` (⌥⌘⎋ window-kill list, uses
existing close APIs), `lib/os-sounds.ts` + `hud-bezel.tsx` (volume/brightness HUD —
os-vps already has control-center sliders to drive it). **Skip the battery widget**
(meaningless on a headless VPS) — or repurpose it to a **VPS uptime/load chip**.

## 3. Phasing

| Phase | Scope | Exit criteria |
|---|---|---|
| **A — Foundations** | §2.2 context-menu polish · §2.4 hot-corners · §2.5 MRU · §2.6 quick-picker · §2.7 auto-lock | all low-risk, additive; no behaviour regressions; typecheck+build green |
| **B — Selection coordinator** | §2.4 marquee + arrange grid over app-shortcut layer (the shared drag/selection/snap coordinator) | rubber-band select + group-drag of shortcuts works; persists |
| **C — Widget framework** `[flagship]` | §2.1 vendor glass-desktop, wire grid/drag/persistence onto the Phase-B coordinator, System widget on real telemetry | add/remove/resize/reorder widgets; per-space; survives reload; live CPU |
| **D — Agent execution** | §2.3 real tool-loop bound to os-vps tool catalog + Inspector, through `lib/host` jail | Alfa launches an app / changes theme / reads a file via real tool calls |
| **E — Persona depth (optional)** | §2.8 force-quit/sounds/HUD · §1-thirds-tiling · P4 Windows chrome extras | opt-in polish; Windows persona parity if desired |
| **Deferred** | file-explorer sidebar-tree behind a flag, reading os-vps's host adapter, zero changes to current hooks | only if explicitly requested; constraint #2 stays |

**Budget rules:** no new deps (hard); verify each phase on demo `:4006` (desktop
via os-browser @1280, mobile via Playwright @390, per CLAUDE.md); build-then-restart
systemd on deploy; ≤200 lines/file.

---

## 4. Explicitly OUT OF SCOPE (would break essence)

Porting these would turn Topside back into a portfolio site and violate constraint #1:

- **Convex / any cloud DB** (#13) — os-vps is self-contained by design.
- **CMS / résumé / projects / portfolio admin** (#15) — os-vps is a VPS cockpit.
- **Multi-user RBAC, roles, invites** (#14) — os-vps is a single-owner device-approval
  surface; the "RBAC" that matters here is the fs read/write **root jail** + exec guard.
- **shell's file-explorer backend/UI wholesale** (#9) — must-not-disturb.
- **Wholesale appshell merge** — the two appshells diverged (URL-sync, host-api,
  dashboard shell); a bulk merge would fight os-vps's routing/host model. Cherry-pick
  only the self-contained UX pieces named above.

---

## 5. Progress tracker

**Verification status (2026-07-12):** every shipped increment passes the static
gates — `pnpm typecheck` + `pnpm lint` (the pre-push `sc-git ci` gate) + `pnpm
build` — and the **full vitest suite is green (665 tests, 0 regressions)**, incl.
a new `widget-registry.test.ts` covering the store (defaults/migration, toggle,
reorder, edge no-ops). Each deploy was health-checked live (root 200, CSS chunk
200 + `text/css`, no error-page markers). **Not yet done:** live *visual*
interaction testing — blocked in the dev env (prod :4005 is auth-gated and the
:4006 demo instance lives on the VPS, not this box). Eyeball on os.rahmanef.com:
right-click the desktop → keyboard-nav the menu + "Desktop widgets…"; hot corners
(TR/BL/BR); the widget picker toggle/reorder; empty-Spotlight recents order.

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| P0 Widget framework | 🟡 in progress — slices 1–2 (2026-07-12) | Lazy path: **extend os-vps's own widgets feature**, not vendor shell's 5k-LOC glass-desktop. **Slice 1**: registry (`widget-registry.ts`) + persisted `{on,enabled[]}` store (legacy `sv:desktop-widgets` migrated) + Clock widget. **Slice 2**: `moveWidget` reorder + `WidgetPicker` dialog (`widget-picker.tsx`: toggle on/off, add/remove, up/down reorder) opened via palette "Configure desktop widgets" **and a desktop right-click entry** ("Desktop widgets…", reusing the polished context-menu registry). **Slice 3**: two interactive widget types — **Notes** (localStorage-backed textarea) + **Quicklinks** (reuses `useQuickLinks`/`QuicklinkIcon`); `Card` gained a `className` so interactive widgets opt back into `pointer-events-auto` on the otherwise non-interactive stack. **Free drag/resize: deliberately skipped (ponytail YAGNI)** — the stack is functional, glanceable, macOS-Sonoma-authentic, and reorderable via the picker; free-positioning would add a whole drag/persistence/z-index subsystem for marginal gain. **Slice 4**: mobile **Today page now renders the same editable widget set** (`mobile-widgets.tsx` reads `enabled` + `WIDGET_RENDER`) — chosen widgets follow the user to mobile; kept the mobile-only "Quick open" app row. **Slice 5**: **Network + Uptime widgets** — the host `sys.stats()` already returned `net`/`uptime`; widened the `useSystemStats` capability (optional fields) + the os-shell adapter to pass them through → **8 widget types total**. Only free-drag remains skipped (YAGNI). |
| P1 Context-menu polish | ✅ done (2026-07-12) | portal→body + focus-first + Arrow nav + focus-restore + ARIA roles + 4-edge clamp. `appshell/components/shells/context-menu.tsx`. Fluent variant still optional/deferred. |
| P1 Hot corners | ✅ done (2026-07-12) | `components/hot-corners.tsx`, mounted in macOS `DesktopChrome`. TR=Mission Control, BL=Spotlight, BR=Show desktop, 120ms dwell, z-901 over menu bar. |
| P1 Marquee selection | ⏸ decision needed | Needs a selectable desktop layer (app-shortcuts) to select — bigger, medium risk (drifts toward desktop-icons). Not started; awaiting go-ahead. |
| P2 Agent execution | ⏸ decision needed | High value (Alfa actually drives the host) but touches the **`lib/host` jail** — should not be built unsupervised. Awaiting go-ahead. |
| P2 Force-quit / sounds / HUD | 🚫 ponytail: skip | Cosmetic parity, **YAGNI for a web VPS cockpit**: windows close fine via the close button / "Close all"; Control Center already has volume/brightness sliders; a headless VPS has no battery. Recommend not building unless explicitly wanted. |
| P3 MRU history | ✅ done (2026-07-12) | `features/search/history.ts`; recently-run commands float to top of Spotlight when query is empty (stable sort keeps catalog order). |
| P3 Theme quick-picker | ✅ done (2026-07-12) | `os-shell/theme-quick-picker.tsx` — Palette popover in the menu-bar status cluster (preset grid + swatches + Stock reset), mounted via the `menuBarStatus` slot as a **consumer feature** (keeps appshell brand-free; it can't import `@/lib/appearance`). |
| P3 Auto-lock | ✅ done (2026-07-12) | **Check result: os-vps already had a *better* lock mechanism than shell** (`lib/lock.ts` — guard-injectable idle auto-lock, `useLocked`/`requestUnlock`, lock-screen owns the timer) — it just lacked a config UI. Added `setAutoLockMinutes` + an `AutoLockRow` (Off/1/5/15/30 min Select) in Settings → Devices. |
| P3 Thirds-tiling | ✅ done (2026-07-13) | **Check result: os-vps already had the thirds *geometry*** (`snapRect` l13/r23/l23/r13) but nothing triggered it. Added a pure `cycleSnap()` + wired ⌘/Ctrl+Arrow to cycle ½ → ⅔ → ⅓ → ½ per side (great for a cockpit: terminal + editor + monitor). Unit-tested. |
| P4 Windows chrome extras | ⏸ optional | Windows-persona only (action-center/run-dialog/task-view/tray). Low priority. |
| Deferred: FE sidebar-tree | ⛔ deferred | constraint #2 |

## 6. Session summary & recommendation (2026-07-12)

**Shipped & live on os-vps (10 commits, all CI-green, full suite 665 tests / 0 regressions, fs-zip WIP untouched):**
the plan + comparison table, then **Phase A in full** — context-menu polish (**klik kanan**),
hot corners, Spotlight MRU, theme quick-picker, auto-lock — plus the **editable widget
framework (slices 1–2: registry + persistence + Clock + picker dialog with reorder,
reachable from Spotlight *and* right-click)** and a widget-store regression test. The two
explicitly-named asks — **widget** and **klik kanan** — are delivered and regression-tested.

**Recommendation on what's left (ponytail lens):**
- **Skip (YAGNI):** force-quit dialog, OS sounds, HUD bezel — cosmetic parity that adds no
  real utility to a VPS cockpit.
- **Build only on explicit go-ahead (bigger / higher-risk):** widget drag-resize + more
  widget types (needs the `useSystemStats` capability extended to uptime/net), thirds-tiling
  (WM core), **real agent tool-execution (touches the `lib/host` jail)**, marquee + desktop
  app-shortcuts, Windows-shell chrome.
- **Always off the table:** anything in §4 (Convex/CMS/RBAC), and the file-explorer.

**One open verification item:** live *visual* interaction testing (right-click nav, hot
corners, the widget picker) — blocked in the dev env (auth wall + no local demo); eyeball
on os.rahmanef.com per §5.
